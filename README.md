## Creational Patterns
These patterns deal with **object creation mechanisms**, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

* **[Abstract Factory](https://github.com/kamronbekrustamov/DesignPatterns/blob/main/AbstractFactory.md)**
    * *Description:* Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
* **[Builder](https://github.com/kamronbekrustamov/DesignPatterns/blob/main/Builder.md)**
    * *Description:* Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
* **[Factory Method](https://github.com/kamronbekrustamov/DesignPatterns/blob/main/Factory.md)**
    * *Description:* Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
* **[Prototype](https://github.com/kamronbekrustamov/DesignPatterns/blob/main/Prototype.md)**
    * *Description:* Creates new objects by copying an existing object (the prototype).
* **[Singleton](https://github.com/kamronbekrustamov/DesignPatterns/blob/main/Singleton.md)**
    * *Description:* Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

---

## Structural Patterns
These patterns deal with the **composition of classes and objects**.

* **[Adapter](https://example.com/adapter-link)**
    * *Description:* Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
* **[Bridge](https://example.com/bridge-link)**
    * *Description:* Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
* **[Composite](https://example.com/composite-link)**
    * *Description:* Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
* **[Decorator](https://example.com/decorator-link)**
    * *Description:* Attaches new responsibilities to objects dynamically.
* **[Facade](https://example.com/facade-link)**
    * *Description:* Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
* **[Flyweight](https://example.com/flyweight-link)**
    * *Description:* Reduces memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects.
* **[Proxy](https://example.com/proxy-link)**
    * *Description:* Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

---

## Behavioral Patterns
These patterns are concerned with **algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects**.

* **[Chain of Responsibility](https://example.com/chain-of-responsibility-link)**
    * *Description:* Passes requests along a chain of handlers; each handler decides whether to process or pass the request.
* **[Command](https://example.com/command-link)**
    * *Description:* Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing or logging of requests, and support for undoable operations.
* **[Iterator](https://example.com/iterator-link)**
    * *Description:* Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
* **[Mediator](https://example.com/mediator-link)**
    * *Description:* Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling.
* **[Memento](https://example.com/memento-link)**
    * *Description:* Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, so that the object can be restored to this state later.
* **[Observer](https://example.com/observer-link)**
    * *Description:* Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
* **[State](https://example.com/state-link)**
    * *Description:* Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing to change its class.
* **[Strategy](https://example.com/strategy-link)**
    * *Description:* Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
* **[Template Method](https://example.com/template-method-link)**
    * *Description:* Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.
* **[Visitor](https://example.com/visitor-link)**
    * *Description:* Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.
